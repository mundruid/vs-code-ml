# vs-code-for-ml

This repository includes material for the Charleston Data Science Meetup (2023-02-23) and can be a standalone reference as well.

What is included:

- Slides created with Jupyter slides and markdown. The slides were created with the notebook: `dev_env_ml.ipynb` and the output is in the html file: `html/dev_env_ml.slides.html  `
- Jupyter notebooks, and
- Data analyzed in notebooks. You will need to unzip the data to run the notebooks with these.
